I don't create beautiful code. I primarily want to understand how stuff works. Old computers are my way to understand the fundamentals of computer architecture with the added advantage of nostalgia. 

### My story

I'm a historian at heart. I try to understand how stuff works by tracing stuff back in time. I'm a biologist by training, and I make a living understanding life's blueprint, juggling sequences of A's, C's, G's and T's. I guess you call me a bioinformatician, although I've never had any formal training in computer science. My interest in computers comes squarely from my Commodore 64. This little machine is where I wrote my first - trivial - programs, in BASIC. I also did some PASCAL programming in secondary school and early in my first year in university. Then - nothing for a while. But I'm a data-junky, and as I got more and more into molecular genetics, getting more and more of those A's, C's, G's and T's in, I realized to get a good fix from all that data I needed to code. So, since then, my work involved not only DNA code but computer code too - Perl, R, and, my favorite, Python. It also got me hooked on Linux. I wanted to learn more about computer architecture. And discovered that those 8-bitters of my youth were actually perfect for learning just that. Moreover, I discovered electronics is fun, and soldering is Zen. At this blog I intend to share some of my discoveries. Don't expect me to create useful tools, and certainly not beautiful code. I just want to know how stuff works.
